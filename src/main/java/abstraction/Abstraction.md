## Abstraction 

1. There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java:
	* Abstract class
	* Interface
2. Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
3. A class that is declared with abstract keyword, is known as abstract class in java. 
4. It can have abstract (just method signature) and non-abstract methods (method with body).
5. It cannot be instantiated.
6. An abstract class can have fields (state), abstract method, non abstract method, constructor and main() method.
7. Adapter class feature: The abstract class can also be used to provide some implementation of the interface. In such case, the end user may not be forced to override all the methods of the interface.
